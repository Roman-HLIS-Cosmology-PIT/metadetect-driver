Example output data from PyIMCOM. 

he `images` directory contains a two subdirectories: H158 and J129. Each one contains an example Mosaic generated by running PyIMCOM on the OpenUniverse 2024 (OU24) images. For the purposes of testing and running simple examples, each Mosaic is composed of 2x2 Blocks, so the images are much smaller than the produced coadds from OU24. The code for producing these simple coadds will be on a different github repo soon.

The `configs` directory contains the json files used to produce the mosaics.
